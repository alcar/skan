# skan
Skeletal animator in Haskell.

## Quick disclaimer
This project is not currently being maintained.  
The modeling part is somewhat done, apart from a few features; some of them are listed in `skan.hs`. The other part, that generates the animation using the positions saved to `savedWorld`, still needs to be developed.
